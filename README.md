1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
   2) Manually run them locally before pushing code
   3) Run them all after all development is completed

I would do it with a github action to ensure no one forgets to test the code whenever there is a change

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

No. This is because an end to end test is too broad to know the specific result of the function

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?

navigation mode uses the website after it loads but it cannot be modified. Snapshot uses the specific instance that currently appears on screen. Navigation mode is fast and quick, Snapshot can dive into specifics of the page but is more time consuming


4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.

    1) We could optimize and compress the images in order to save memory. Specifically, use the same resolution as the size of the images
    2) Could add accesibility towards mobile devices by adding a viewport tag
    3) We could add a meta description in order to add a helpful description of the website when it appears in search results
